Digital Twin Technology for Personalized Medicine

Overview:

Digital Twin Technology involves creating a virtual replica of a physical entity or system that can be used for analysis, simulation, and optimization. In the context of personalized medicine, a digital twin is an individualized computational model of a patient's physiological systems. This model can simulate responses to treatments, predict disease progression, and assist in clinical decision-making, leading to more precise and effective healthcare interventions.
